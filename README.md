# kickstarter-analysis
##  Overview of Project
  * Analysis of the Kickstarter project gives us the  outcomes of the campaigns based on different criteria's such as based on country, category, launch date, etc.     By doing the analysis we also came to know how successful these campaigns were.
##  Analysis and Challenges
  * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88983020/131928085-55d90438-d2c8-42fa-8120-d886ea677d4c.png)
  * According to the analysis theatre campaigns are most successful campaigns in comparison with othe campaigns followed by music and film & video. Most of the         kickstarterâ€™s were well funded according to the goal and pledge.  
  * Challenges that i faced was to show the graphical representation and to put the data into the self explanatory graph, which is easy to interpret. I overcame         this challenge by understanding what kind of data is presented in the analysis and by puting that data into mutiple graphs and charts and choosing the right         one.
##  Results
  * Two conclusions made out from Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are, in month of May there are highest number of successful kickstarter campaigns and in month of     December there are lowest number of successful kickstarter's
  * From Outcomes based on Goals the conclusion is there are 0% of cancelled campaigns.
  * Other tables we could add are, outcome based on deadline day, outcome for different countries etc.
